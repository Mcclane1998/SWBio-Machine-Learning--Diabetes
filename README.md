# SWBio-Machine-Learning--Diabetes
This repository consists of a small machine learning project to classify presence of diabetes using 3 different machine learning algorithms and to evaluate the results/predictions to find the best algorithm among the 3. 
The notebook was created on Google Colab and the data was imported after mounting the google drive onto the notebook and then importing from the "Dataset" folder where the csv file was stored on the drive
I wanted to do this so I could learn how to mount the drive in a Colab notebook in futre for machine learning projects based on images. 
The repository also contains the datset itself downloaded from Kaggle. 
Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbours (KNN) and Support Vector Classification (SVC) were the 3 algorithms used for diabetes prediction based on 8 different parameters mentioned in dataset
